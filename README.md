As part of CS1050 - Computer Organization and Digital Design Module in 2nd Semester, our team designed a 4-bit nanoprocessor in VHDL using Vivado. We also developed a simple counter program and hardcoded it to the processor ROM, We uploaded it to a Basys3 FPGA board, and rigorously simulated the counter for functionality.
